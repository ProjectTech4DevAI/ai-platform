Create a new version for an existing configuration.

To create a new version, provide the `config_id` in the URL path and the new
configuration parameters in the request body. The system will automatically
create a new version under the same configuration with an incremented version number.
Version numbers are automatically incremented sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.)
and cannot be manually set or skipped.
